<h2>Hello World!</h2>

<p>Hello, internet! I was jotting down the possible ideas that I could ue as my first blog post. And I though t why not talk about  

<p>This is my passion project website where I document my art, poetry, publications, readings, thoughts, and much more; basically the idea is to experiment with the mediums I can get my hand over and push my creative boundaries. I just wanna be more productive and stay minimal.</p>

<p>So here is the basic idea of this website/blog,</p>

<p>╰(*°▽°*)╯ Happiness</p>

<p>(❁´◡`❁) Stay Positive</p>

<p>((⌐■_■) Own your Stuff</p>

<p>I have tried most of the website builders out there on internet, but I am not happy with them. Too many distractions on the websites I build. The main point of the blog is just lost. Too much ads, analytics, crazy animations, and its not my cup of tea.</p> 

<p>I like to keep it simple, modest and stay to the core principles of why I choose to blog.</p> 

<p>The blog is build using HTML and CSS {^_~} only.</p> 

<p>Things I do:<p>
<li><b>#reasearch</b>: content research has been a huge part of my life, from my school days, where I used to read books and articles to search more about the topics that rose curiosity in me.</li>
<li><b>#editing</b>: editing is the art of making a piece of work more presentable, be it written work or an artistic work. I embrace the content to meet the audience experience.</li>
<li><b>#poetry</b>: I write Haiku, Haiban, Senryu and Tanka.</li>
<li><b>#illustration</b>: I do technical, as well as digital illustrations professionally and as a hobby.</li>
<li><b>#doodling</b>: I doodle my thoughts, ideas, and cartoons, which elevate my creativity and art without constraints.</li>
<li><b>#storytelling</b>: podcasting, youtubing and blogging keeps my stories alive in all 3 mediums, audio, video and static.</li>
