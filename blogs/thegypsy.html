<h2>A story with no title and no end.</h2>
<h5><i>October 04, 2023</i></h5>

<p><i>You read it right, this is a story that has no title. A title is mostly given when the write-up is intended to suit a particular audience and it catches their eye. But just imagine telling a story with no title, and the author is effectively able to communicate what he/she wants. Interesting isn't it?</i></p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a gypsy who traveled across lands, crossing the rivers and streams, who had stories to say. He was patient to listen to them, to memorize them, and to understand the morals. He then passed the rushing ones, the men who he saw everywhere he went; on his barefoot with just a stick and a jute sack tied to its end.</p>
<p>He interacted with everyone and everything on his way and collected stories that he could tell others on some land later in his journey. The gypsy had no final destination. He wanted to wander around and collect stories from around the world he thought flat. He even debated with people who said the world was round, some of them said squared with harsh corners where winds of the sea allowed none to cross.</p>

<p>He climbed the tall mountains and mostly camped there at the treetops to avoid wild animals. But he found ways to interact with the wild so as to hear their stories. It was a rumor in many lands he visited that he could understand what the animals talked about. He was himself a walking book, with lots of stories, from unknown lands.</p>

<p>On a sunny day after the rainy season ended, he came across a writer who was stalking a farmer lady in her solitude. The writer was peeping generously across a huge oak tree to find out about the lady. The gypsy was fascinated to know what the writer was doing and what made him fond of that lady.</p>

<p>He didn't ask the writer but decided to climb the tree from the back and stalk at the writer. The gypsy was now curious to know what the writer was writing, though he didn't know how to read or write, the new land's language.</p>
<p>The next moment, a white horse came past the farmer lady from deep woods, crossing the river flowing between the farm and the forest. The moment was so mesmerizing that the horse sprang across the river. The clear water made its reflections and accepted the ripples created by the legs. The horse slowed down as it saw fresh grass on the farm ferry. The farmer lady broke her solitude and her eyes were stuck on the horse.</p>

<p>The horse suddenly saw a grasshopper on the fresh green grass. The horse was so happy to see a small insect enjoying, the freshness and nectar on the grass. The horse stood in cold river water enjoying the beauty of nature and curiously watching what the grasshopper was doing. And the loop continued. Each one was busy just to find out what the other one was doing, just like you.</p>
