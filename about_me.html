<hr>

<p>I am a technical development editor currently working for Packt Publications. I enjoy writing, reading, editing, coding and formatting. I work professionally on technical documents and illustrations.</p>

<p>Notepad and MS Word are my text editors of choice.</p>

<p>I studied Mechanical Engineering at Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kochi, completing my bachelor's degree in 2019. I now live and work in India.</p>

<p>I am interested in Indian Hindustani music, Hip-hop, Instrumental: Folk, Turkish, Arabic, Indian, and Jazz. I play Kazoo, Kanjira, Recorder flute, and Jaw Harp. Also beatboxing is my other fun activity.</p>

<p>I love to tell, hear, and read stories. This made reading books, something more than just a hobby to me. The stories in them made me <b>think</b> out of the world. Not just fiction books, I embrace the true value of storytelling in non-fiction too. The ones that I truly enjoy reading are the ones that put the story forward to express and elaborate on a philosophy; be it tech, politics, science, cinema, or even self-improvement books.</p>

<p>I read more articles, newsletters, wikis, and forums than a whole book. More in the sense it consumes 65% of what I read.</p>

<p>I am on a journey to weld the mastery in the alchemy of not-so-often combinations of philosophy, language, art, science, technology, and design. I try to be creative and productive and stay simple and true to the nature of how things happen around me.</p>
