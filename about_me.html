<h3>Expression:</h3>

<p>It was at the age of <i>24</i>, that I realized what I wanted to do in my life. I became more passionate about writing, reading, poetry, and creating new stuff. I want to create great stories and share them with people. I want to spread happiness. I want to help people tell great stories. I chose to become a writer, a poet, and an editor. I help people develop better thinking through my work.</p> 

<p>DIY became my sole purpose in life. I invest my time in learning new things, experimenting with them, thinking about the philosophies and ideas to achieve better in life, and trying to implement them.</p>

<p>It was at this same time that I became a strong minimalist. I learned about it and started to practice it in my life. I read books and researched how to practice it without sacrificing more. I do not preach extreme minimalism, because I think it's a form of constraining ourselves, and moreover, it's boring.</p>

<p>I reuse and reduce the usage of most of my stuff, another way I keep things minimal.</p>

<h3>Tech Use:</h3>
<p>
<li><b>Notepad</b> and <b>MS Word</b> are my text editors of choice.</li>
<li>I use <b>Google Keep</b> for my task management, keeping notes and guides, and also bookmark some links.</li>
<li>I use an <b>HP Pavilion Laptop</b>. I mostly use it for coding, graphic design, and simple gaming.</li>
<li>I have a <b>Microsoft Windows 11 Home Single Language OS</b>.</li>
</p>

<h3>Education:</h3>

<p>I studied <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> at Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kochi, completing my bachelor's degree in 2019.</p>
<p>The majority of my knowledge and skills are acquired through reading books, blogs, newsletters, forums, etc. I take maximum advantage of learning from peers and nature.</p>
<p>I also follow various free courses available on the Internet, like Alishon courses, YouTube, etc.</p>

<h3>Interests:</h3>
<p>I am interested in Indian Hindustani music, Hip-hop, Instrumental: Folk, Turkish, Arabic, Indian, and Jazz. I play Kazoo, Kanjira, Recorder flute, and Jaw Harp. Also beatboxing is my other fun activity.</p>

<p>I love to tell, hear, and read stories. This made reading books, something more than just a hobby to me. The stories in them made me think out of the world. Not just fiction books, I embrace the true value of storytelling in non-fiction too. The ones that I truly enjoy reading are the ones that put the story forward to express and elaborate on a philosophy; be it tech, politics, science, cinema, or even self-improvement books.</p>

<p>I read more articles, newsletters, wikis, and forums than a whole book. More in the sense it consumes 65% of what I read.</p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>I am on a journey to weld the mastery in the alchemy of not-so-often combinations of philosophy, language, art, science, technology, and design. I try to be creative and productive and stay simple and true to the nature of how things happen around me.</p>

<p>Create a world for yourself and keep it progressing and growing with time. I want to think and learn better.</p>

<h3>More about me:</h3>
<p>
<li>I multi-task. I have various projects running parallelly. I attain zen when I have things to work on. But I single-task at a time. I comply to finish a task and move ahead, without trying to focus on multiple things at the same time.</li>

<li>I think more practical stuff and long-term.</li>

<li>I love my family and live with them.</li>

<li>I cook and love cooking. Biriyani, curries, fried savories, burgers, and Indian cuisine are my specialties.</li>

<li>I am a vegetarian and practice a more protein-based diet.</li>

<li>If I get a laptop and a clean, well-ventilated space to work, I will be very happy. I do need good food, water, and a sanitation facility though. But this does not keep me away from my family. I like to keep a very good personal space for myself and others.v

<li>I hate noise. I don't like to be in a noisy place. I don't like crowded places too. I am a peaceful person who loves to be in a calm place.</li>

<li>I hate to waste a single hour. I tend to keep myself engaged in some activity and add value to myself in every minute I spend.</li>

<li>This page will be updated as soon as something exciting occurs, or something extra I do.</li>
