<!--about me-->
<h2>Me in short✌️</h2>
<p>Hi, I am Arun. I also go by my pen name <b>AKG Bhat</b>.</p>

<p>I am a <b>technical development editor</b>, currently working at Packt Publications. I help authors to develop great technical content and improve their writing. I guide them to maintain a consistent tone, style and format through the technical document. I also help to maintain the pipeline of book production from manuscript stage to final editorial sign off, working along with other editors, product managers, graphics team and various external stakeholders.</p> 

<p>I am passionate about writing, reading, editing, coding and formatting text mediums, like blogs, newsletters, books, EPUBs etc.</p>

<p>This is a journey to weld the mastery in the alchemy of not-so-often combinations of philosophy, language, art, science, technology, and design. I try to be creative and productive and stay simple and true to the nature of how things happen around me.</p>
