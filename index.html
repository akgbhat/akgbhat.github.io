<h2>Me in short✌️</h2>
<p>I am a <b>technical development editor</b>, currently working for Packt Publications. I enjoy writing, reading, editing, coding and formatting. I work on creating and editing technical documents and illustrations, to make them a better user guides.</p>

<p>I am on a journey to weld the mastery in the alchemy of not-so-often combinations of philosophy, language, art, science, technology, and design. I try to be creative and productive and stay simple and true to the nature of how things happen around me.</p>

<p>This website is meant to be my eJournal, where I document my journey, thoughts, and ideas, books that I read, my daily routines, cool tech stuff.</p>
